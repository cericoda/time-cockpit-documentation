# Signal Tracker for Notes	

The signal tracker for user notes allows you to capture small notes about your work. Notes are more lightweight than time sheet entries so you interrupt your workflow less when capturing a note.

## Collected Data

The signal tracker for user notes does not track data without user input. You can hit a keyboard shortcut to enter a note. Additionally the signal tracker is able to determine breaks (see also [Signal Tracker for user activity](user-activity.md)) and ask you for a note when you continue with your work. This may for example happen when you return from a meeting to your PC.

If you exit or pause the signal tracker the keyboard shortcut to enter notes is not available and time cockpit will not ask you for notes after a break.
