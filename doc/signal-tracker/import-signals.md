# Import Signals from Text Files	

The signal importer is able to import signals from CSV files.

Time cockpit can import signals from CSV files. At the moment this function is not officially released, but if you need to import your own signals please contact as at [support@timecockpit.com](mailto:support@timecockpit.com). We will gladly help you to get your own signals into time cockpit.
