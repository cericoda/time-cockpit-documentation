## Actions in the Time Sheet Calendar

If you have reoccurring tasks that you want to accomplish in the time sheet calendar, you can create actions in time cockpit. Learn how to build a new action at [Actions](~/doc/scripting/actions.md). If the action does not need an input set, the action is always available. If the action takes one or more time sheet entries as input set, you can only call the action if you have selected one or more time sheet entries in the calendar.
