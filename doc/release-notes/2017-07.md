## Performance

### Caching of Combo Box Values

In the new version, values for combo boxes are cached in the local storage of the browser. Time cockpit maintains the last update version per model entity. The web client fetches the last update versions regularly and cleans up the cache when the last update version of a model entity has changed. This improves the load time of filters in lists and edit forms.

### Caching of Static Files

We have improved caching of some static files (CSS, JavaScript, JSON resources) which were not cached in previous versions. This improves the initial load time of time cockpit.
