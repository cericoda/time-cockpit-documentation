## Badges for Environment and Sandbox

Last month we started to offer two new time cockpit environments: https://web-preview.timecockpit.com and https://web-dev.timecockpit.com ([read more about the new environments](http://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2017/05/09/Change-to-Our-Release-Cycle)). To make it easier to recognize your current environment, we have added badges f√ºr the DEV and PREVIEW environment to the menu:

Additionally, you may have a [sandbox environment](https://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2016/05/27/Playing-in-the-Sandbox) for testing changes in your data model. Sandbox environments are now also marked with a badge:
