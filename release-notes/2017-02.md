# February 2017

## Signals in Web Client

We have added most of the signal data features of the Full Client to the HTML5 Client. Green and yellow bars next to the time sheet entries indicate booked and unbooked time. The bars on the right side show you how much time you have spent with different applications, window titles or to which LAN you were connected.

## Changes in the List "Budgetary Control of Tasks"

- The listâ€™s filter section was extended with a new filter called "Include Closed Projects". Until now, time sheets on closed projects have always been displayed. From now on, you can choose whether or not to display time sheets on closed projects.
- We changed the behavior of the existing filter "Only Tasks with Unbilled Time Sheet Entries". If this filter was deactivated, only tasks with time sheets were displayed. Now, it also displays tasks without time sheets.

## Changes in the List "Budgetary Control of Projects"

The column "Revenue" is renamed to "Revenue by Time Sheets". Furthermore, we changed the calculation of this column. Until now, all working hours were used to calculate the revenue. From now on, only billable working hours are used.

## Changes in the List to Check Working Time Violations

From version February 2017, active travel time will also be considered by the check for break times. Until now active travel time was not included in the summation of working hours to check break times. A general introduction to this topic can be found in the article [Active and Passive Travel Time for Working Time Limits](http://www.timecockpit.com/blog/2016/09/30/Active-and-Passive-Travel-Time-for-Working-Time-Limits).
